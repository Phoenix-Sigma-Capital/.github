# Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Financial Models

Algorithmic trading utilizes quantitative financial models to automate trading decisions based on predefined criteria. Developed by financial engineers and quantitative analysts, these models analyze extensive datasets to spot market trends and make predictions. Key techniques include statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining. 

The core objective is to pinpoint profitable trading opportunities, manage risks, and execute trades at the most opportune moments, often surpassing the speed of human traders. Automating the trading process helps enhance efficiency and diminish the influence of human emotions on trading decisions. As a result, these models are integral in the landscape of modern financial markets.
